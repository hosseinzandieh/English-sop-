Due to my interest in computers and working in the field of IT, I chose this field. The reason for choosing Payame Noor University was the reasonable cost and travel, as well as the lack of compulsory classes at this university. I want to study professionally in this university. Networking, internet and cyberspace are my specialties. I want to go to the army first and then continue my studies. I'm interested. I have a passion for basketball and my friend should be informed about the university.
